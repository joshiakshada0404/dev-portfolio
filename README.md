## Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, MongoDB, Figma, and Git version control. The website is designed to showcase your projects, skills, and experiences to potential employers or clients.

## Features
The portfolio website includes the following features:
1. I have designed a website that has separate views for the viewers and myself as the user. As the user, I can modify the website by adding, deleting, or updating projects without the need to edit the code.
2. Home page with an introduction and links to your projects, skills, and contact form.
3. Projects page with a list of your projects, each with a thumbnail image, title, description, and link to the project.
4. There are two methods of adding skills to the website, with or without a description, and they will appear differently on the website.
5. Contact page with a form for visitors to send you a message.
6. The superuser has the ability to view and interact with the inbox (unseen count/seen).
7. Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
The portfolio website is built using the following technologies:

1. HTML for the website structure and content
2. CSS for the website styling
3. JavaScript for the website interactivity
4. Django for the website backend and routing
5. MongoDB for the website database
6. Figma for the website design and layout
7. Git for version control and collaboration

To run the portfolio website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
